      <description>This model has powerful digging claws and can burrow through the ground as fast as other beasts can walk. The model may begin the game underground and be placed anywhere on the table when they take their first Action during the first Turn, provided that no enemy is within 2” of that position and there is no Terrain piece at that position. This counts as a Move Action, so the model will only have one Action remaining in its Activation.

The model does not have to deploy on the first Turn but can instead wait and deploy later. However, if they choose to wait, it becomes harder to judge where they will pop up and the model will scatter. Place the model, then roll a d8 and add the Turn number (i.e. on Turn three, add +3 to the dice roll) to determine how far in inches they scatter. Move the model in the direction the tip of the dice is pointing.

If the model would be placed in a space occupied by another model or a Terrain piece as a result of scattering, place it next to it and the Tunnelling model suffers d6 Wounds; these Wounds are not affected by Tough or Delicate Skills of any kind.</description>

If the target model wins the Roll-off or the Roll-off is drawn, the Spell is resisted and fails. If the caster wins, the Spell succeeds.
The target is forced to perform an Action immediately, decided by the caster’s player. This Action may not be a Cast Action or use any single-use equipment, and may not use any of the target’s Fate points or Skills; for example, an Attack Action by a Controlled hare would not benefit from the hare’s Strong (1). Being Controlled does not use up the Controlled model’s normal Actions for the Turn.</characteristic>

        <characteristic name="Rules" typeId="fdfb-3e87-f3bd-88ce">A model must have the Fearless Skill before being equipped with a Cheirosiphon. Shooting Skills do not apply to this weapon.

When a model equipped with a Cheirosiphon makes a Shoot Action, ignore the usual Shoot Action rules. Instead, the Shooting model must decide how long to hold the trigger; Short, Medium, or Sustained:
- Short burst:        Range of 8”, uses a Ranged Stat of d8 and a d6 Misfire dice.
- Medium burst:    Range of 12”, uses a Ranged Stat of d12 and 2d6 Misfire dice.
- Sustained burst: Range of 18”, uses a Ranged Stat of d20 and 3d6 Misfire dice.

Roll the Ranged Stat dice for the Shooting Roll-off, and roll the Misfire dice at the same time. If any of the dice rolled (including the Ranged Stat dice) are a 1, then a Misfire has occurred. Roll on the Cheirosiphon Misfire Table. Making a straight line between the Shooting model and the target model, all models within 1” of that line are potentially hit. The Shooting model only rolls once; but each potential target model rolls to Defend and compares their Total to the Shooting model’s Total.

If a target model rolls a 1 on their Defend Nimbleness Roll, they take damage as normal but also gain the Condition ‘Burning’.

CHEIROSIPHON MISFIRE TABLE
1 - Detonation!: The cheirosiphon does not fire – instead, it explodes. The user and any models in Base Contact immediately go Out of Action, with all Wound boxes crossed off; any models within 6” suffer d12 Wounds, ignoring Armour. The cheirosiphon is destroyed and cannot be repaired.
2 - Blowback: The cheirosiphon does not fire – instead, the flame mix is blown back across the user. The user and any models in Base Contact suffer d20 Wounds, ignoring Armour.
3–5 Overheating and Sputtering: The user and any models in Base Contact suffer d12 Wounds, ignoring Armour, from overspill of burning fuel.
6 - Surge: The weapon’s valve sticks open and it empties the full load of fuel in one go! Regardless of whether the player chose a Short, Medium, or Sustained burst, roll again, using a Range Stat of d20+7 (do not roll further Misfire dice). After this, the weapon may not be used for the rest of the game.</characteristic>
